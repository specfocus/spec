Convention Over Configuration (CoC)

**Default Conventions**: Frameworks or systems following this pattern have default conventions for various aspects of the application, such as naming conventions, folder structures, and behavior.

**Reduced Boilerplate**: Developers don't need to write as much configuration code because the framework assumes sensible defaults based on the conventions.

**Explicit Overrides**: Developers can still provide explicit configuration when needed, usually when the application's requirements deviate from the default conventions.

**Consistency**: This pattern encourages consistent coding practices across the application, as developers adhere to the same set of conventions.

**Faster Development**: Developers can focus on implementing business logic rather than spending time on routine configuration tasks.

**Readability**: The codebase becomes more readable as developers familiar with the conventions can quickly understand the application's structure and behavior.
